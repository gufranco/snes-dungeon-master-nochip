## What this changes

One or two sentences. What is different afterwards, and why it needed to be.

## How it was checked

Paste the output rather than describing it. A claim that the tests pass is not evidence that they
did.

```text
```

- [ ] `ruff format --check .` and `ruff check .` are clean
- [ ] Every test module runs
- [ ] `python3 doctor.py` reports nothing on this machine
- [ ] Where microcode is present, `python3 tools/verify_trace.py` still reproduces every recorded byte

## If this changes what a routine answers

The part's own microcode is the authority. A change to what a routine gives back has to say which
command, what went in, and what the part answers, because a value that came from anywhere else is a
value nobody can act on.

## What it does not carry

- [ ] No cartridge, no microcode, and no bytes from either
- [ ] Nothing that says where to obtain them
